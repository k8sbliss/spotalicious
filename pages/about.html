<h1>What is <img style="width:150px;height:40px"  src="/img/spotalicious.png" alt=""> ?</h1>

<p>Spot-a-licious is for anyone who loves and supports Food trucks!</p>

<p>It is a web app that allows users to track where their favorite Food Trucks are. It also allows users to share to fellow Food truck lovers whenever they spotted a Food Truck that is not on our weekly schedule.</p>

<h3>Behind the app....</h3>

<p><b>Spot-a-licious</b> was created as the capstone project of this girl named <b>Kate</b> for her Front-end Web Development class at this amazing Dev Bootcamp called <a href="http://www.devpointlabs.com/" target="_blank">DevPoint Labs</a>.</p>

<p>A Food Truck, which is the generic term used in this app, refers to all mobile food vendors whether its a truck, cart, or trailer. And since Kate lives in Utah, this app is for all Food Trucks in Utah.</p>

<p>Please be advised that since this project was done in about 30 hours throughout 9 days which includes idea brainstorming, coffee, planning, coffee, chocolates, studying/research, coding, chocolates, coffee, design, and more studying and research, coffee, and more coding, and did I say more coffee and chocolates? - that this app is still in the early stages of its life. There is definitely a plan to make this a real fully functional app with more features, so watch out or it!</p>
